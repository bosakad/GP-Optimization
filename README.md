# Novel Geometric-Programming Formulations  in Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits

Geometric programming is often used in the layout and timing problems of circuit design. The gate size problem is perhaps the best known special case. As far as we know, the literature has used deterministic delay models, so far. Independently, a statistical static timing analysis has been developed into a powerful tool for estimating timing in digital circuits. This thesis presents two solutions of the statistical approach to the gate sizing problem using mixed-integer programming and geometric programming. In particular, a histogram approximation of the statistical approach is employed. Another significant part of the thesis includes the solution to finding a general multiplication of two numbers using only optimization variables.
